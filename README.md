### About me:
- Development data nerd - One day there will be a job with the title Development Data DataOps Officer, and I want that job
- I am expert at Stata knows how to code in Python, R and js as well. 
- My job current job as Data Science Consultant at the World Bank involves supporting 100+ projects on how to set up workflows for anything between data collection to data management to data analysis. It also includes training non-technical people that work with data in the data tools I suggest. I have trained 500+ researchers in Git/GitHub, data security and data privacy practices. 
- My favorite quote from my training materials is: "My time and my career are not more important than the privacy of the humans participating in my research" - I make the participants of my data security training say it out loud three times.
